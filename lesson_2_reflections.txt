What happens when I initalize a git reposetory?  why do you need to do it?
I guess it mostly just creates the hidden .git directory.  it doesn't make a commit though.  So we've got to do that ourselves.  
This directory is needed to track your changes in git.  

how is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  what advantage does it have?
So the working directory is not activly being tracked, but it allows you to add files to begin tracking them, but
can remove them if you decide not to track them.  Not particularly sure why this is beneficial.
