When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all work local?
I imagine the number 1 reason for remote repository is collaboration.  Like how Dan said he and Dragan worked on papers.
Another point is as a backup.  If all your files are only local then you run the risk of losing everything on catastrophic
computer failure.
