When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all work local?
I imagine the number 1 reason for remote repository is collaboration.  Like how Dan said he and Dragan worked on papers.
Another point is as a backup.  If all your files are only local then you run the risk of losing everything on catastrophic
computer failure.  

why is manually pulling from github, rather than doing it automatically, better?
One thing is then you can work without internet.  Thats sometimes nice.  Also, this way you don't 'publish' the code you're working on before you're ready.

Differences between forks, branches, and clones.  
Clones are copying a repository to your local workspace, either from github or elsewhere on your local space.  Forks go github to github, generally from one person's to another (giving credit)
branches act on the repository itself, creating a new distinct version within the current repository.

what is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of teh remote stored locally?
It would be nice to see what commits haven't been pushed to github yet.  that would help in understanding mergers.  It could also be reverted back to that state whenever.
you could check what the diff is before you push.

how would you collaborate without using github or git?
I would probably use dropbox and google docs like I do with kayla on the budget spreadsheet.  It works fine for that, but it doesn't remember every iteration of the docs.  So git could help there.
Splitting into various branches would also be more difficult.
